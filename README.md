# GNSS
This repository contains Python scripts developed as part of a GNSS-focused technical project. 

It is split into two folders: Acquisition-Tracking and PVT Solution. 

- The first one includes some scripts simulating a SDR (Software Defined Receiver) in the acquisition and tracking processes. (For now the acquisition part is completed and the tracking part is still in process).
- The second one includes a complete project where different algorithms are developed to finally compute a PVT solution. The project explores various aspects of satellite positioning and navigation, implementing essential algorithms and corrections for accurate GNSS-based solutions. Alongside the scripts, a comprehensive technical note is included, with a description of the project and an alysis of the obtained results.

Note: Input files used in the project are not included in this repository as some of them contain confidential information.

-----
In process: A related project utilizing C++ is underway and will be added to a new repository as soon as possible.
